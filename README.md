# CapstoneVapeInventory
Change in Capstone 

SO i did a change to what i was doing my project on. There was too many properties to do in the character thing.

I had issues getting this into gitHUB with the oush and sync, so i had to do it by uploading. the file is in the CapstoneVapeInventory-Master. the others arent updated, but the data folde ris in the -master route. i was trying to figure out how to remove other files. this is where i struggled with this assignment is navigating GitHUB.
